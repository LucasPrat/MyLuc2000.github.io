Welcome to everyone to my personal webpage.

I am very happy to have my own personal web page, created by myself using my knowledge of HTML, CSS and GIT.
Thanks to github I have been able to launch this page to the Internet.
I'm so proud of my self!!

I recommend to everyone who likes technology, to launch their own website to the Internet. Its awesome asf.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
